## Ressources Déployées

- **Réseau privé virtuel (VPC)** : Fournit un réseau privé pour les ressources cloud.
- **Cluster Kubernetes** : Gère les conteneurs de l'application.
- **Container Registry** : Stocke les images Docker nécessaires pour le déploiement de l'application.
- **Base de Données (Redis)** : Déployée en environnement `dev` et `prod` pour le stockage.
- **Load Balancer** : Assure la répartition du trafic pour chaque environnement (`dev` et `prod`).
- **DNS** : Crée des enregistrements DNS pour l'accès à l'application en fonction de l'environnement.

## Variables Utilisées

- `project_id` : Identifiant du projet.
- `zone` et `region` : Zone et région pour le déploiement (`fr-par`).
- `environments` : Environnement de déploiement (`dev` ou `prod`).
- `student` : Nom de l'étudiant utilisé pour les noms DNS.

## Résultat de terraform Plan

```hcl
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
